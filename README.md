## Summary
There are 72,458 number of roles that need to be filled as the silver tsunami begins to make an impact.
There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the department to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
When examining the employees table, we noticed that there are no employees that was born in the 1970s; therefore the management needs to hire younger employees so the company will not experience a silver tsunami.
